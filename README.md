## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all required packages using the requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all necessary dependencies including:
- PyTorch and TorchVision
- TensorFlow
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

### 3. Run Programs

Simply execute any Python file directly:

```bash
python Simple_Grid_Problem.py
```

Or for the pre-trained model example:

```bash
cd "Pre-trained Model Classification"
python main.py
```

Note: Some programs will automatically download datasets (MNIST, 20 Newsgroups) on first run.
